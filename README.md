- **Noise Reduction & Deblurring**: Removes artifacts introduced by poor camera quality.
- **Facial Feature Enhancement**: Fine-tuned model optimizes reconstruction accuracy.
- **Dataset Processing**: Preprocesses images for effective training.
- **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Developed for a competitive challenge demonstrating practical applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
